## Editor Configurations
Development teams working on projects usually have agreed-upon coding conventions they follow.. Editor configuration provide a great way to keep consistency across different editors.

In this project, we have adopted the following conventions;
- end_of_line = lf
- insert_final_newline = true
- trim_trailing_whitespace = true 
- charset = utf-8
- indent_style = space
- indent_size = 2

## Package Management
In almost every project a team works on, they will make use of different packages for different purposes, this would necessitate the use of a package manager to handle all the project package dependencies, keeping track of all their versions within the package.json file

The most popular package manager is `npm`, which we use on this project

To add `npm`, install the `node` available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
